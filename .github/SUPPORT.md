## Getting Help

Control Dojo is a utility distributed "as is." You are responsible for building, maintaining, and troubleshooting your own custom controls. Nintex does not provide support for Control Dojo through standard support channels; use the resources below instead.

### Self-Service Resources
- `README.md` for setup instructions, architecture notes, and troubleshooting basics
- `docs/` folder for deep dives on manifest configuration, data binding, localization, and styling
- Control-specific `README.md` files inside the `Controls/` directory

### Specialized Solutions
If you need tailored implementation, custom development, or dedicated guidance, you can engage the Nintex Professional Services team. Such engagements are billed separately. For official options and wording, see the Nintex documentation and Professional Services offerings on the Nintex website.

### Governance and Access
- Write access to this repository is limited to the Nintex Cyberpunks maintainers noted in `.github/CODEOWNERS`
- External contributors should fork the repository if they need local modifications; upstream pull requests are not accepted
