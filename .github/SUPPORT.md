## Getting Help

Control Dojo is distributed “as is” and all customer assistance runs through Nintex Support rather than GitHub issues or discussions. Use the guidance below to make sure your request reaches the right team with the context they need.

### Primary Support Channel
- Submit a ticket through Nintex Customer Central (https://customer.nintex.com/). This portal is the only approved path for troubleshooting, bug reports, or access questions.
- If you do not have Customer Central access, contact your tenant administrator or Nintex account representative to be added.
- For alternate submission paths (unauthenticated emergency form or follow-up contact info), see the "Submit a support case" section on the Nintex Customer Success page (https://www.nintex.com/customer-success/).

### What to Include
Providing the following information in your ticket speeds up triage:
- Control Dojo version or Git tag (for example `v1.0.0`)
- Environment details (on-premises or cloud host, OS version, browser version)
- Exact steps to reproduce the issue, including sample control definitions if applicable
- Relevant server logs or console output (attach files rather than pasting large blocks into the ticket)
- Screenshots or short videos demonstrating the behavior

### Self-Service Resources
- `README.md` for setup instructions, architecture notes, and troubleshooting basics
- `docs/` folder for deep dives on manifest configuration, data binding, localization, and styling
- Control-specific `README.md` files inside the `Controls/` directory

### Governance and Access
- Write access to this repository is limited to the Nintex Cyberpunks maintainers noted in `.github/CODEOWNERS`
- External contributors should fork the repository if they need local modifications; upstream pull requests are not accepted

### Contacting Support
If you encounter ticket routing issues or Customer Central access problems, email support@nintex.com as a fallback and include your open ticket number once one is assigned.
